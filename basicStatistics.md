### 10% condition
The 10% condition states that sample sizes should be no more than 10% of the population.

### 68 95 99.7 Rule in Statistics

### Absolute Error & Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
error between true value and your measurement

### Accuracy and Precision
* Accuracy is how close you are to the true value. 
* Precision is how close two or more measurements are to each other.

### unit root
A unit root (also called a unit root process or a difference stationary process) is a stochastic trend in a time series, sometimes called a “random walk with drift”.

### Augmented Dickey Fuller Test
The Augmented Dickey Fuller Test (ADF) is unit root test for stationarity. Unit roots can cause unpredictable results in your time series analysis.

### Coefficient of Determination (R Squared)
The coefficient of determination, R2, is used to analyze how differences in one variable can be explained by a difference in a second variable. R-squared gives you the percentage variation in y explained by x-variables. The range is 0 to 1 (i.e. 0% to 100% of the variation in y can be explained by the x-variables.

### adjusted R squared
R2 shows how well terms (data points) fit a curve or line. Adjusted R2 also indicates how well terms fit a curve or line, but adjusts for the number of terms in a model. If you add more and more useless variables to a model, adjusted r-squared will decrease. If you add more useful variables, adjusted r-squared will increase.
Adjusted R2 will always be less than or equal to R2. You only need R2 when working with samples. In other words, R2 isn’t necessary when you have data from an entire population.
