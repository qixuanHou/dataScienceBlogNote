### What is Bitcoin?
```Bitcoin is used to Encrypt the currency into the digital format and which is highly secured.```

Questions - 
* what does it mean to encrypt the currency?
* who controls how much bitcoins should be distributed?

The second link describes the bitcoin as two component. One is bitcoin-the-token, "a nippet of code that represents ownership of a digital concept", and the other is bitcoin-the-protocol, "a distributed network that maintains a ledger of balances of bitcoin-the-token". It also answers my questions by stating that "without passing through a central authority, such as a bank or payment gateway". I am more confused by how "Bitcoin are produced by computers with free software". 


* Who created it?
A pseudonymous software developer going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto proposed bitcoin in 2008, as an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof. The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way.

* But it differs from fiat digital currencies in several important ways:
  * <strong>Decentralization</strong> - No single institution controls the bitcoin network. It is maintained by a group of volunteer coders, and run by an open network of dedicated computers spread around the world. 
  * <strong>limited supply</strong> - Fiat currencies (dollars, euros, yen, etc.) have an unlimited supply – central banks can issue as many as they want, and can attempt to manipulate a currency's value relative to others. (I originally thought fiat currencies are limited while bitcoin is not.) With bitcoin, on the other hand, the supply is tightly controlled by the underlying algorithm. A small number of new bitcoins trickle out every hour, and will continue to do so at a diminishing rate until a maximum of 21 million has been reached. This makes bitcoin more attractive as an asset – in theory, if demand grows and the supply remains the same, the value will increase.
  * <strong>Pseudonymity</strong> - While senders of traditional electronic payments are usually identified (for verification purposes, and to comply with anti-money laundering and other legislation), users of bitcoin in theory operate in semi-anonymity. Since there is no central "validator," users do not need to identify themselves when sending bitcoin to another user. When a transaction request is submitted, the protocol checks all previous transactions to confirm that the sender has the necessary bitcoin as well as the authority to send them. The system does not need to know his or her identity.
  * <strong>Immutability</strong> - Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed, unlike electronic fiat transactions. This is because there is no central "adjudicator" that can say "ok, return the money." If a transaction is recorded on the network, and if more than an hour has passed, it is impossible to modify.
  * <strong>Divisibility</strong> - The smallest unit of a bitcoin is called a satoshi. It is one hundred millionth of a bitcoin (0.00000001) – at today's prices, about one hundredth of a cent. This could conceivably enable microtransactions that traditional electronic money cannot.

But it failed to gain the public trust and confidence. Recently a software was developed for financial and informational storage transactions which are advanced and secure, especially the information in it can not be altered or hacked by anyone. It is nothing but the “Blockchain”.

### what is blockchain?
Blockchain is a chain of blocks where each block is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions. In this technology systems are distributed with a collection of networks, which means all computers in the network stores the same information.
Blockchain can potentially change the following industies, education, bank, insurance.
