### Analysis the startups 
The data is from Angel.co. 
Angel.co is a platform where job-seekers can look for a job at startups, as well as investors and companies can find each other for partnership. 
The goal is figure out which state has active and big startups. The takeout from this post is to filter out the outliers, like CA and NY in this example, so that we can further analyze the similar states. The other one is to include more info into graph, to consolidate the information we have.
