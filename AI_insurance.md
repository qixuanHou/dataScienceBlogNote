#### Example
"Imagine that you plan to personalize health insurance quotes for people having various heart conditions. This requires precise, real-time, individual heart-tracking. To access this data, insurers can fully or partly cover the price of a wearable device (e.g. Apple Watch or other) that would track heart rhythm and stream collected data to a server. Then this data must be analyzed against the insurantâ€™s electronic health record (EHR) dataset to infer predictions on whether a given person may shortly need medical attention. The higher the risk, the higher the monthly or annual quote is."
