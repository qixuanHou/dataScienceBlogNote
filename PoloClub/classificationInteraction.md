## Interactive Classification for Deep Learning Interpretation
### ABSTRACT
We present an interactive system enabling users to manipulate images to explore the robustness and sensitivity of deep learning image classifiers. 
### INTRODUCTION
To create trust, both researchers and the gen- eral public have to understand why models behave the way they do.
#### Interactive Classification for Interpretation
* Users are able to remove selected areas of an image in real time with classical computer vision inpainting algorithms
* Allowing a human user to select the regions to be inpainted enables more semantically meaningful regions
#### Significance of Our Approach

### Usage Examples
