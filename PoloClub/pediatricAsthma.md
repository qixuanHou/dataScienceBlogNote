### Abstract
* key - We designed and developed an in- teractive visual analytic process exploration and discovery tool and used it to explore clinical data from 5784 pediatric asthma emergency department patients. 

### Introduction
* Gap - refining process is developed in many other fields but not healthcare
* Motivation - we have records and data
* Goal - designing and developing an interactive visual analytic process exploration and discovery tool for understanding the state of pediatric asthma emergency department (ED) care. 
* Process - data preprocessing and analysis, design, implementation, and evaluation
