## Visual Analytics in Deep Learning:An Interrogative Survey for the Next Frontiers
### ABSTRACT
Deep learning has recently seen rapid development and received significant attention due to its state-of-the-art performance on previously-thought hard problems. However, because of the internal complexity and nonlinear structure of deep neural networks, the underlying decision making processes for why these models are achieving such performance are challenging and sometimes mystifying to interpret.
