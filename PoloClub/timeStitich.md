##  TimeStitch: Interactive Multi-focus Cohort Discovery and Comparison

https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dchau/papers/15-vis-timestitch.pdf
### ABSTRACT
TimeStitch extracts common sequences of events performed by abstinent smokers from large amounts of mobile health sensor data, and offers a suite of interactive and visualization techniques to enable cohort discovery, construction, and comparison, using extracted sequences as interactive elements.
### INTRODUCTION
Questions can be asked
* Which events or sequences of events commonly precede smoking lapses? 
* What are the lifestyle choices that may trigger such lapses? 
* Are there subsets (cohorts) of abstinent smokers that exhibit similar or different behaviors? 
* How do we discover and define such cohorts? 
The functionalities of TimeStitich
* Focal event Sequences as Interactive Elements for Cohort Discovery. 
* Interaction Techniques and Focal Sequences for Cohort Construction.
### TIMESTITCH INTERFACE DESIGN
PrefixSpan sequence mining algorithm  
* retrieving a list of frequent events, 
* partitioning the data around these ‘prefixes,’ 
* appending sequential elements to them recursively
