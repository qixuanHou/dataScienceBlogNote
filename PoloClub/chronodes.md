## Chronodes: Interactive Multifocus Exploration of Event Sequences
### ABSTRACT
We present Chronodes, an interactive system that unifies data mining and human-centric visualization techniques to support explorative analysis of longitudinal mHealth data. Chron- odes extracts and visualizes frequent event sequences that reveal chronological patterns across multiple par- ticipant timelines of mHealth data. It then combines novel interaction and visualization techniques to enable multifocus event sequence analysis, which allows health researchers to interactively define, explore, and compare groups of participant behaviors using event sequence combinations.

### INTRODUCTION
#### Our Contributions
* mHealth data introduces unique challenges that existing tools for analyzing EHRs do not adequately address. Chronodes is one of the first attempts to explore how to best represent and explore mHealth data, combining data mining and human-centric visualization tech- niques to aid data exploration, pattern discovery, and fine-grain analysis of longitudinal mHealth records.
* Chronodes introduces two novel capabilities that help health researchers interactively explore and combine sequences to ask important, complex questions such as “what happens between first lapses that precede high activity, and second lapses that follow low activity but high stress?” 
* We conducted an informal study with 20 expert researchers from a spectrum of mHealth
related disciplines. By summarizing the insights gained, we outline important open re- search and design challenges in developing the mHealth field, and offer recommendations and design guidelines for future research.

### RELATED WORK
#### Visualization of Multiple Timelines
#### Event Alignment
#### Cohort Analysis
An alternate approach to understanding the trends of aggregated mHealth data streams is to con- sider groups of patients as cohorts, or individuals that share certain properties [4, 23]. 
#### Sequence Mining and Pattern Matching
Building machine learning and pattern matching algorithms into interactive visualizations presents promising opportunities for enhancing human pattern-finding abilities. Hochheiser and Shneiderman [18] and Buono et al. [7] demonstrated how users could select specific patterns in quantitative data streams and see where else they were found. 

### DATASET, RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AND DESIGN MOTIVATIONS
Before beginning development on Chronodes, we obtained real-world mHealth datasets collected through field studies investigating the use of the AutoSense Sensor Suite for inferring a general stress state [11]. In the first of these studies, 6 participants (who smoke) wore the sensors for 3 days, totaling about 400 hours. In a later study, the same format of data was recorded for 52 partici- pants before and after planned smoking abstinence (prequit and postquit, respectively), with each participant’s data totaling approximately 6 days [33]. The sensor suite recorded 40 data streams for each participant, capturing a wide variety of physiological signals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and heart rate variability (HRV) measurements. The resulting datasets consisted of more than 750,000 and 4,650,000 data points, respectively (sampled at 1Hz). The AutoSense data represents one of the few mHealth data initiatives available for research use, as collecting good-quality mHealth data is a great technical challenge due to limitations in sensor hardware and battery technologies [9, 11, 15].
Following data collection, we regularly discussed with health researchers on our team, whereby we worked to determine questions about this data that an interactive visualization tool should help to answer. As we developed Chronodes, we showed them iterative designs of our prototype for feedback and improvement suggestions. Accordingly, specialists in health psychology and sta- tistics (see Table 1) identified four initial questions that informed tasks in mHealth data analysis, which primarily concern identifying physiological states, habitual patterns, and external circum- stances that can be correlated to smoking lapses, across participant demographics:
Q1 What are the events preceding and proceeding each instance of smoking lapse [5]?
Q2 What habitual events or cues (e.g., smoking every day after lunch) are correlated to smok-
ing lapse [25]?
Q3 What are the correlations between smoking lapse and other physiological factors, such as
stress [2, 10]?
Q4 What event patterns are specific to individual participants, and otherwise universal to all
participants [26]?
Using these target questions as our point of departure, we identified existing techniques in visual analytics and mHealth data analysis (as elaborated in Section 2) that would assist in answering these questions with respect to the AutoSense data. Principally, we identified that event alignment would assist in answering Q1 by allowing users to align participant timelines around smoking lapse events. We also determined that an implementation of cohort definition would provide support to answering Q3 and Q4: users should have the capability to select particular groups of participants— according to specific physiological factors or event patterns of interest—that would reveal factors specific to these populations.
Accordingly, in acknowledging that Q1, Q2, and Q3 each addressed the importance of discov- ering event patterns, we experimented with frequent sequence mining as an approach to defining participant cohorts. To accomplish this, we first produced a series of sketches and graphical mock- ups that envisioned how event patterns could be used to represent cohort groups, with a partic- ular emphasis on the representation of when event patterns occur over time. Concurrently, we produced “dummy” event-based data that reflected the size and dimensions of the AutoSense data, and experimented with a series of frequent sequence mining algorithms to determine whether such an algorithmic approach was tractable and could reveal event patterns preceding and proceeding smoking events.
As an outcome of these experiments, we identified that mining mHealth data for recurring event sequences operates to answer Q2 and Q4: it permits investigations of participant behaviors within days, across days, and between participants. However, to address Q1, we needed to provide users with the capability to select events of interest, such as smoking lapse events. Accordingly, by adapt- ing “event alignment” into “frequent sequence alignment,” we developed an approach to answer- ing Q1: we allow Chronodes users to investigate the frequent sequences that occur before and after aligned sequences of interest. Then, to address Q3—finding correlations between smoking events and physiological factors—we developed an approach to representing physiological factors as events (Section 6). For example, we can consider a high-stress activity and a drive to work as different events, and represent them within frequent sequences once they are mined. As we intend for Chronodes to be applied to a wide variety of health conditions, it was additionally important that the process of converting physiological factors to events was made user adjustable. Accord- ingly, we enable users to adjust event definitions interactively as in Fails et al. [12], before the events are mined for event sequence patterns. How these events are derived, and the implications of defining events in this way, are discussed in later sections.
