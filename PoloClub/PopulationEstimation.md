## A Deep Learning Approach for Population Estimation from Satellite Imagery
### Abstract
* The goal
  estimate population, and where do they live 
* Why the topic is important
  urban development, infectious disease containment, evacuation planning, risk management, conservation planning, and more
* The gap
  bottom-up. survey drivern censuses is expensive to realize in a frequent manner, and can only provide popluation counts over broad areas
* The method
  a deep learning modal for creating high resolution population estimations from satellite imagery 
  * train CNN to predict population in the USA at a 0.01°×0.01° resolution grid from 1-year composite Landsat imagery. 
  * validate with two ways
    * quantitatively, comparing the results to several US census county-level population projections
    * qualitatively, interpreting the model's predictions in terms of the satellite image inputs
* Generally
  the modal presents how machine learning techniques can be an effective tool for extracting information from inherently unstructured, remotely sensed data to provide effective solutions to social problems.
